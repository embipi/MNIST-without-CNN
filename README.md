# MNIST-without-CNN
A classical approach to Computer Vision

---

The acronym for the name of the MNIST data set comes from "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology" and represents one of the prototypical problems of computer vision since its origin in 1999. It contains images of handwritten numbers that serve as lines basis for improving visual recognition algorithms. It consists of images with a dimension of 28x28 pixels out of a total of 784x70,000 pixels between the training and test sets, each pixel containing a value between 0 and 255 as a measure of its intensity, where 0 is the darkest value and 255 is the lighter value.

Throughout this Jupyter Notebook it is intended to solve the classification problem posed by MNIST using classification models with a classical machine learning approach while some improvements are proposed for these visual recognition algorithms.

Specifically, we will focus on the SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors models to face the exercise.

### **Disclosure**

This notebook is presented as an example for educational purposes on the application of classical models to problems normally seen from the point of view of Deep Learning. It also aims to demonstrate the sensitivity of the models with respect to the data used as input and the difficulty associated to solving the problems of Computer Vision. Also, some comments may be in spanish but they only refer to the code.
